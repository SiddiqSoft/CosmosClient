# Objective

## Features
- C++20 Azure Cosmos REST API client.
- JSON everywhere
- Simple interface -- this means we limit the options you can fiddle
- Implement the SQL REST API

## Development Style

- Continuous improvement
  - During early stages, development is going to be private until a first release candidate source.
  - We break ABI often.
- Focus on end-use and ease-of-use over performance
- Build what is needed and add features subject to the above criteria

## Requirements
- The build and tests are for Visual Studio 2019 under x64.

# API / Usage
- Use the nuget [SiddiqSoft.CosmosClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SiddiqSoft.CosmosClient/)
- Copy paste..whatever works.
